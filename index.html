    <h1>An Apothecary's Guide: Lesson 277: Mycology</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our humble guide for aspiring apothecaries!</p>
    <p>For this lesson, we will talk about mushrooms!</p>
    <p>While there are many types of mushrooms in the arboretum, it would help to know what each one does!</p>
    <p>Generally, avoid mushrooms with green on them. Those ones are... volitile.</p>
    <p>Ones with red on them are superfoods, anything that feeds on them will get real strong real quick.</p>
    <p>Ones with white on them are generally average.</p>
    <p>Ones with blue on them make for great fertilizers!</p>
    <p>Purple ones have some strange effects, so don't touch those!</p>
    <p>Yellow ones have a whole lot of vitamin D in them!</p>
    <p>And Orange ones taste like oranges!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Something tells me that, if you tried to pick a bunch of mushrooms, and got a green or purple one, you'd drop all of the ones on you... which could be useful, in all honesty.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our state-of-the-art mushroom farms makes sure that there is essentially an infinite amount of each mushroom in the farms, though how it works is a little iffy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you plan on making fertilizer, well, I have a killer fertilizer recipe for you!</p>
    <p>But first, I'd have to explain how it works.</p>
    <p>When I made this fertilizer, I came up with a color point system.</p>
    <p>Essentially, you make the fertilizer based on the mushroom colors!</p>
    <p>The mushroom's main color provides 2 points, while the color of the spots give one point.</p>
    <p>For example, a white mushroom with red spots would give 2 white points and 1 red point.</p>
    <p>This ultimate fertilizer of mine requires...</p>
    <p>10 blue points.</p>
    <p>1 white point.</p>
    <p>7 red points.</p>
    <p>5 yellow points.</p>
    <p>And 3 orange points.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, be sure to not tell anyone! It'd be a shame if someone stole my recipe!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Wait, isn't all of our lessons recorded and transcribed on our website?</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>...An-anyway! Class dismissed!</p>
